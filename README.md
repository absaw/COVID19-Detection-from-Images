COVID-19 is a respiratory infectious disease, so it can be significantly detected through radiology of lung abnormalities.
So, diagnosis will be possible merely from the CT scans or X-Ray image reports of a person
This application allows a person to get diagnosis result in few seconds by uploading a single image.
Increases the efficiency of testing process.
Person from any part of this world can undergo COVID test. 
Improvements :
In this model CT scan model performance should increase so that it helps in predicting COVID more accurately.
On collecting more COVID19 related data there is a chance of increasing model performance.
