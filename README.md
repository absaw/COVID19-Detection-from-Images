<h1>COVID19-Detection-from-Images</h1>
<p>

<li>COVID-19 is a respiratory infectious disease, so it can be significantly detected through radiology of lung abnormalities.
<li>So, diagnosis will be possible merely from the CT scans or X-Ray image reports of a person
<li>This application allows a person to get diagnosis result in few seconds by uploading a single image.
<li>Increases the efficiency of testing process.
<li>Person from any part of this world can undergo COVID test. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
  <b>Scope for Improvements :</b>
<li>In this model CT scan model performance could increase so that it helps in predicting COVID more accurately.
<li>On collecting more COVID19 related data there is a chance of increasing model performance.
